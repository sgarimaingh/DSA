## Binary Search Problems

### 1. First and last Index of X
Given a sorted array and a target X, find first and last index of X, if not present , return -1.

### 2. Search in sorted rotated array

Example:
        I/P = {{1,4,6,8,10},
               {2,7,9,12,15},
               {3,11,20,22,24},
               {5,16,25,30,40}}
               
```
