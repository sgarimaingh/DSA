## Sorting Problems

### 1. Sort 0 1 array
Given an array of 0's and 1's, sort the array in one traversal.

### 2. Search in sorted rotated array
Given a sorted rotated array with unique elements and a target, find index of the target, if not present , return -1.

### 3. Search in rotated 2D matrix
Given a row-wise and column-wise matrix of size M*N, find the target X.

```
Example:
        I/P = {{1,4,6,8,10},
               {2,7,9,12,15},
               {3,11,20,22,24},
               {5,16,25,30,40}}
               
```
