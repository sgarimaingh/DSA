## Array Problems 

### 1. Two sum Problem
Given an array and a target, find 2 numbers whose sum is equal to target. Array has one unique solution.

### 2. Three sum problem
Given an array and a target, find triplets whose sum is equal to target. Do not repeat triplets.
eg: [1,2 3] is same as [3,1,2]

### 3. Smallest No. whose product of digits is N
Given a positive no. N, need to find the smallest no. S such that product of digits of S is equal to N.
```
Example:
        I/P = 1000
        O/P = 5558
```

### 4. Majority Element (having N/2 frequency)
Given an array of size N, need to find the majority element such that it occurs more than N/2 times. there can be atmost 1 majority element.

### 5. Rotate Square matrix by 90 degree
Given a matrix of size N*N, rotate it by 90 degree.

```
Example:
        I/P = {{1,2,3,4},
               {5,6,7,8},
               {9,10,11,12},
               {13,14,15,16}}
               
        O/P = {{13,9,5,1},
               {14,10,6,2},
               {15,11,7,3},
               {16,12,8,4}}
```

### 6. Spiral Matrix
Given a matrix of size M*N, print elements in spiral order.

```
Example:
        I/P = {{1,2,3,4},
               {5,6,7,8},
               {9,10,11,12}}
               
        O/P  = {1,2,3,4,8,12,11,10,9,5,6,7}
```

### 7. Four sum problem
Given an array and a target, find quadruplets whose sum is equal to target. Do not repeat.
eg: [1,2 3,4] is same as [3,1,2,4]


### 6. Spiral Matrix II
Given an integer A, generate a square matrix filled with elements from 1 to A^2 in spiral order and return the generated square matrix.
